1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
Ordered sub-list

1. And another item.

You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.

First line.<br>
Second line.

⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
